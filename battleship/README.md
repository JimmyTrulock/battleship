1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

We struggled with figuring out how to start the build as it was difficult to test things were working without a the ability to run tests.
We reached out to other groups that were in similar spots of Iteration 3 and tried to compare notes. Ultimatly we broke down iteriation 3 into 4 groups; main menu, ship placment, turns, and endgame. We then workered through each, one by one.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

We would work on refactoring integration 3 and getting the cpu ship placement to work correctly, without overlaping the ships.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We mostly used driver/navigator to work, however we did do some a-sync reaserch when we became stuck. Us pairing together helped make the coding faster as we had 2 pairs of eyes on the code instead of 1. This let us catch small mistakes faster, insuring quicker turn around in the code.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

All our communication was done through slack's huddle feature and through the pull request review comments. Feedback was done as we worked and at the end of our sessions.
